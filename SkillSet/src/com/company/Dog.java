//Multiple Inheritance -- Of Classes is not supported in Java
//public class Dog extends Animal,Pet {
//}

//But we can have chain/linking of inheritance
//Pet extends Animal Super Class --> Dog Extends from Pet Class
public class Dog extends Pet {

    //Pet pet = new Dog();
    //Super class object can point to its sub class Variable

    //Dog dog = new Pet();
    //Reverse to above does not work --> Dog is subclass of  Pet Super Class


    //Super Class variable is not an instance of Sub Class
