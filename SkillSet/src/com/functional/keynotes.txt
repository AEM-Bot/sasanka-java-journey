Lambda Expressions
        Used for Functional Programming(->)
        shortcut for creating function
        stream is source of object(similarly like Generics)
        Stream Operations --> Intermediate Operation (Filtering as example) --> Output is again stream
                            Terminal Operation Process/consume the element (For example
                            reduce, and forEach )

Functional Interface -->
Foreach -- Consumer Interface
Filter --> Predicate Interface

Functions are First Class Citizens

1. Storing functions in variables
2. Passing functions to methods
3. Returning functions from methods
